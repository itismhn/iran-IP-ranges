# Iran IP Ranges

This repository provides a list of IP ranges allocated to Iran, aiming to help organizations enable access to their assets from within Iran, in line with local regulations. **The intent is to *improve access* for Iranian users, not to restrict or block these IPs.**

## Purpose

- **Enhance Accessibility**: Use this list to allow Iranian users reliable access to services often hindered by local or international restrictions.
- **Network Configurations**: Configure firewalls, VPNs, or proxy services to allow access from Iran as needed.
  
## Important Note

This list is provided to help *enable* access for users in Iran, not to block it.

## Updates

This IP range list will be updated periodically to ensure accuracy and reflect any changes. Check back occasionally to get the latest version.
